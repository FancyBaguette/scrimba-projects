# ðŸŽ“ Scrimba projects
**A repository for all of my projects that i've done for the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path course.**<br><br>

Most of them are so called 'solo projects', where you're just given a design and the requirements of what should be built.<br><br>
Every project folder has a README file with the date of each project's completion date (plus eventual update dates and/or additional notes). I plan to refactor some of the **older** projects in the future using my new knowledge. Below you can find a table with links to a live preview site for every of the projects - the entries are sorted from newest to oldest.<br><br>
